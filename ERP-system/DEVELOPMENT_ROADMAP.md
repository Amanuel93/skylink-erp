# ERP System Development Roadmap

## üéØ Current Status
- ‚úÖ Microservices architecture established
- ‚úÖ Docker infrastructure configured
- ‚úÖ Basic NestJS services created
- ‚úÖ Authentication system foundation
- ‚úÖ Kafka messaging setup
- ‚úÖ Database configuration ready

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
chmod +x setup-dev.sh
./setup-dev.sh

# Or manually copy env templates
cp auth-service/env.template auth-service/.env
cp procurement/env.template procurement/.env
cp sales/env.template sales/.env
cp stock-management/env.template stock-management/.env
cp project-management/env.template project-management/.env
```

### 2. Infrastructure Startup
```bash
# Start all infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
```

### 3. Service Development Priority

#### High Priority (Core Business Logic)
1. **Auth Service** - Complete user management
2. **Procurement Service** - Purchase order management
3. **Stock Management** - Inventory tracking
4. **Sales Service** - Order processing
5. **Project Management** - Project tracking

#### Medium Priority (Integration)
- Kafka event handling
- Inter-service communication
- Data consistency patterns

#### Low Priority (Enhancement)
- Advanced reporting
- Analytics
- Performance optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

### Starting Services
```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Start individual services (in separate terminals)
cd auth-service && npm run start:dev
cd procurement && npm run start:dev
cd sales && npm run start:dev
cd stock-management && npm run start:dev
cd project-management && npm run start:dev
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests for a service
cd auth-service && npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:cov

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Building
```bash
# Build a service
cd auth-service && npm run build

# Build all services
for service in auth-service procurement sales stock-management project-management; do
    cd $service && npm run build && cd ..
done
```

## üìä Service Ports

| Service | Port | Database Port |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Auth Service | 3001 | 5437 |
| Procurement | 3002 | 5433 |
| Sales | 3003 | 5434 |
| Stock Management | 3004 | 5435 |
| Project Management | 3005 | 5436 |
| Kafka | 9092 | - |
| Zookeeper | 2181 | - |

## üîß Development Tools

### Recommended IDE Setup
- **VS Code** with extensions:
  - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
  - Docker
  - REST Client
  - GitLens
  - Prettier
  - ESLint

### Useful Commands
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Access database
docker exec -it [db-service] psql -U postgres -d [database]

# Restart a service
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Port Conflicts
- Ensure ports are not used by other applications
- Check `netstat -an | grep [port]` on Windows/Linux

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify database containers are running
- Check environment variables
- Ensure network connectivity

### Kafka Connection Issues
- Verify Zookeeper is running
- Check Kafka broker configuration
- Ensure proper network setup

## üìà Success Metrics
